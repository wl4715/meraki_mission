# New Catalyst & Meraki DevNet Test Drive
Meraki Mission for new Meraki &amp; Catalyst DevNet Test Drive

## Core track:
Provide audience the possibility to create a very simple network configuration template using APIs. 

	1.	Create network
	2.	Claim devices
	3.	Create VLANs
	4.	Assign to switch ports
	5.	Create SSIDs
	6.	SD-WAN Policies

## Bonus Mission:
Write a script to verify that the config correctly matches the desired one. For example, in wifi, many times users configure the wrong AP RF profile, and then they have wifi problems

For example:

- https://github.com/obrigg/meraki-channel-distribution
