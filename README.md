# New Catalyst & Meraki DevNet Test Drive
Meraki Mission for new Meraki &amp; Catalyst DevNet Test Drive

## Core track:
Provide audience the possibility to create a very simple network configuration template using APIs. 

1. ORG-WIDE -> Create network
2. ORG-WIDE -> Claim devices
3. MX -> Create VLANs
4. MS -> Assign to switch ports
5. MR -> Create SSIDs
6. MV -> Update camera quality & retention settings
7. MT -> Create sensor alert profile

## Bonus Mission:

**Test Driven Automation**

Write a script to verify that the config correctly matches the desired one (linked to previous mission of Thousand Eyes).
Input what the desired configuration should be and check with script if the org matches it.

Other examples out there, in wifi, many times users configure the wrong AP RF profile, and then they have wifi problems. Template we could use:
